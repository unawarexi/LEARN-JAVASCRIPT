# more tips

- methods = volatility of values
- functions = instructions you want to give your values
- eventlisterners = process after function 
- special functions = accessibility

---

# note:
 
  - functions can be put inside functions any non-primitive
  - arrays can be put inside arrays and any other non-primitve
  - objects can be put inside  objects and any other non-primitive

  ```
  javascript is all about where, when and how

  use local functions and variables for specific task

  use global for major task that'll affect the whole code

  master the use of literals and ternary operators

  put your code statements inside the {(
    of any methods, functions
  )}

  break;  statements works only in an if else stement
  ```
  other instuctions would be found when you study the files through
