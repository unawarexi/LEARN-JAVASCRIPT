/**
 *  it uses the concept of scoping
 *  it is known as nested function
 *  the inner function should be called inside the outer function body
 *  the inner function can access values in the outer but outer can't
 * 
 *  it depends on lexical envirenments
 *   1 environment record == the main object it's in
 *   2 reference to outer lexical environ
 * 
 *  ================== what are closures? =================
 * they're inner functions 
 *  they're bundled together with the lexical environ : datatypes
 *  they're declared inside the datatype
 *    in other words the inner functions contains the var of the outer function
